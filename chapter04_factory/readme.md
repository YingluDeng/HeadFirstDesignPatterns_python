# Chapter 4: Factory patterns

**Simple Factory**: A class which chooses which product class to instantiate and return, based upon method parameters.

**Factory Method**: Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. The Factory method lets a class defer instantiation it uses to subclasses.

**Abstract Factory**: Provide an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.

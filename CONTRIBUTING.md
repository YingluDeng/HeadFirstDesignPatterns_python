# Contributing

I welcome feedback : thoughts, comments, issues or pull-requests improving the existing code and documentation. 
I intend to work my way through the remaining chapters in 2021 and am likely to refuse pull requests for new chapters or design patterns I have not yet attempted myself unless I have stopped working on it!

# Chapter 7: Adapter and Façade design patterns

> **Adapter**: Converts the interface of a class into another interface the clients expect. Adapter lets classes work together that couldn't otherwise because of incompatible interfaces.

> **Façade**: Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem.  Façade defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.

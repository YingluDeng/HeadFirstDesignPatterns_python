# HeadFirstDesignPatterns_python
Example code from Head First Design Patterns second edition translated to python to help me understand and memorise the patterns.  

I am aiming for as literal a translation as possible without trying to make the code pythonic beyond, e.g. using python conventions for `ClassNames` and `method_names`.
